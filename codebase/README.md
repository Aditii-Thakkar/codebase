## üöÄ Solution Approach

This project is a React-based frontend application that simulates an energy account management UI with mock backend data. It fulfills the key requirements of displaying energy accounts, handling payments, and showing payment history ‚Äî using modern React practices and a component-based architecture.

### üîß Tech Stack

- **React 19** (via Vite)
- **TypeScript**
- **React Router v7** (for routing)
- **CSS Modules** (for scoped styling)
- **Mock APIs** using in-memory data with `setTimeout`

### üß© Feature Breakdown

#### 1. Energy Accounts Page (`/`)

- Fetches energy accounts from `MOCK_ENERGY_ACCOUNTS_API`.
- Fetches due charges from `MOCK_DUE_CHARGES_API`.
- Aggregates balances per account.
- Displays:
  - Account type (Electricity/Gas)
  - Account ID and address
  - Computed balance with:
    - Green color for positive (CR)
    - Red for negative (DR)
    - Gray for zero
  - ‚ÄúMake a Payment‚Äù button (opens modal)

#### 2. Payment Modal (UI-only)

- Triggered by "Make a Payment" button.
- Displays:
  - Credit card fields (mocked)
  - Account balance
  - Pay button
- Simulates submission and shows a ‚ÄúPayment Successful‚Äù confirmation.

#### 3. Payment History Page (`/history`)

- Displays a list of mock payment records from `MOCK_ENERGY_PAYMENT_HISTORY_API`.
- Each entry includes:
  - Payment date
  - Account address
  - Amount
- Includes a **search bar** to filter by address (case-insensitive).
- Displays fallback message if no match is found.

#### 4. Routing

- Configured using `react-router-dom@7`
- Routes:
  - `/` ‚Üí Account list
  - `/history` ‚Üí Payment history

### üß™ Mock API Strategy

All data is simulated via `Promise` with `setTimeout`.

```ts
MOCK_ENERGY_ACCOUNTS_API(): Promise<Account[]>
MOCK_DUE_CHARGES_API(): Promise<DueCharge[]>
MOCK_ENERGY_PAYMENT_HISTORY_API():Promise<Payment[]>
```
